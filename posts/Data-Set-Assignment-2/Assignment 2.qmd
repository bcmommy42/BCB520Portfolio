## Description of Data Set

This data set is tabular data and the attribute is categorical/quantitative. The data includes the breastfeeding rates (in %) of each state and the mPINC scores (algorithmic data) of each state. I have also included the breastfeeding rates of the different regions, based off of WIC regions. These all are from the year 2018,2020, and 2022.
