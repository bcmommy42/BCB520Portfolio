Current research project is about the potential effects that a Staph. aureus infection may have on the tissue and secretion microbiomes of artificially induced lactation in heifers. When not in the lab, she can be found crocheting, watching medical drama on tv, or playing video games. Often times, her dog Finn or Cat Olivander can be found snuggled in her lap."
